# Interregional Mobility and Gender in Spain

## Short Description

**Analysis of interregional mobility in Spain from a gender perspective.**

---

## Project Summary

This project analyzes interregional mobility decisions in Spain from a gender perspective, using data from the **Survey on Attitudes and Expectations of Spatial Mobility of the Active Population** (Vidal & Busqueta, 2020, N = 3,889), collected in 2019 among individuals aged 18–55 who were employed or seeking work.

The objective is to identify the factors that promote or limit mobility depending on gender and to explore self-perceived obstacles that influence decision-making.

**Main objectives:**
- Identify factors that promote or limit mobility depending on gender.
- Explore self-perceived obstacles influencing decision-making.

The study is structured around three main research questions.

**Research questions:**
1. Do the factors involved in mobility decisions have different effects for men and women?  
2. What are the main self-perceived obstacles to mobility by gender?  
3. How is the perception of obstacles associated with sociodemographic characteristics and mobility or immobility decisions?

The code in this repository covers the full process: **data cleaning and transformation**, **descriptive analysis**, and **statistical modeling** using multinomial logistic regressions by gender, with calculation and interpretation of **average marginal effects**.

The results show that while economic and labor-related factors influence men and women similarly, family ties are particularly decisive for women. Cohabitation with a partner reduces women’s willingness to migrate, whereas perceiving opportunities for improvement in the family sphere increases it. Furthermore, women report family-related obstacles more frequently, while men tend to highlight labor or financial constraints.

Overall, the project demonstrates that understanding interregional mobility in Spain requires going beyond economic factors: it is essential to incorporate the central role of family and gender dynamics in shaping mobility and immobility decisions.

**Key findings:**
- Economic and labor-related factors similarly affect men and women.  
- Family ties are particularly decisive for women.  
- Cohabitation with a partner reduces women’s willingness to migrate.  
- Family-related obstacles are reported more by women; labor/financial obstacles more by men.
